A Music Player for android that makes use of the Visualzer Class for rendering a beautiful **DNA** (***Visualization***) of the currently playing music.

## Background
The Music Player draws inspiration from [paullewis's music-dna](https://github.com/paullewis/music-dna/).
The Player uses the FFT Data supplied by the **Visualizer** class of Android , calculates the Amplitude at that particular moment and plots the **DNA**.

## The Player
MusicDNA combines the usefullness of a traditional Music Player app with the beautiful visualizations.
The Player allows users to play both **local music** as well as Stream Music directly from **SoundCloud**.
The Player also packs a **Powerful Equalizer with** ***BassBoost and Reverb*** effects
